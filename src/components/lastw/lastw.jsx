                    <p>The most important thing I want to make clear to you is that the life of a designer can be completely different. You can do what you love without exhausting yourself, without having to choose between creativity and income, while maintaining your freedom and inspiration. <span className='opspan'> You, too, can live and work by your own rules if you strive for them and take action.</span></p>
