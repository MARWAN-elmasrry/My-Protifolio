                        <p>When I was 8 years old, my father taught me how to change the background image or color. I was amazed that I could control the device with just a few steps.</p>
                        <p>At the age of 10, I discovered the internet and began playing online games, as well as browsing websites like YouTube and Facebook.</p>
                        <p>Two years ago, while browsing YouTube, I accidentally pressed the F12 button and opened the Chrome DevTools, but I didn't understand anything.</p>
                        <p>After this, I learned HTML and built my first webpage, which I shared with my friends. One of them noticed that I liked programming websites and gave me some courses on programming.</p>
                        <p>And I built a second webpage. Here is the link to <a href='https://marwan-elmasrry.github.io/myproject/index1.html'>Akatsuki</a>. I built this website using HTML and CSS.</p>
                        <p>And here we are; I have learned and obtained certificates in web development, which can help me create webpages on the internet and host them.<span className='pspan'>"</span></p>
